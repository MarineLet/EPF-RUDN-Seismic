# EPF-RUDN-Seismic

This project was developed for the Geospatial Programming class of Spring 2020, an international collaboration between two universities, EPF (https://www.epf.fr/) of France and RUDN of Russia (http://www.rudn.ru). 

We are two aerospace students at EPF (https://www.epf.fr/) of France, who got the oportunity to work with ArcGIS Pro on the seismic activity around the world. This project was made possible thanks to our professor Mr Naci DILEKLI (https://github.com/ndilekli/).

The project aims to show the areas in the world that are at risks concenrning the seismic activity in the world. The 2 types of risks that were taken into account for this project are: the human risks (with the population density) and the economic risks (with the size of the urban area). To make this project even more interesting especially for people working on seismic risks, our program is highly customizable. Thus, this allow the user to completly see one phenomenon or risk according to its own criteria.

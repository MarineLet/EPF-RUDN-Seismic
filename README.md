# EPF-RUDN-Seismic

This project was developed for the Geospatial Programming class of Spring 2020, an international collaboration between two universities, EPF (https://www.epf.fr/) of France and RUDN of Russia (http://www.rudn.ru). 

We are two aerospace students at EPF (https://www.epf.fr/) of France, who got the oportunity to work with ArcGIS Pro on the seismic activity around the world.
